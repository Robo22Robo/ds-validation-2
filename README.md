Validation - Exercise #2 - Express Validator

In this exercise we are going to introduce express validator. We will use it to check incoming form data. We will assure the sent data is how we expect it to be to secure the integrity of our database data.
Validate form data with express validator

Continue working on your previous exercise code OR copy your previous server.js file to here and repeat the installation of express.

    Install express-validator => npm i express-validator

    Import the function "check" and "validationResult" from the express validator package at the top of your server.js file

    Adapt your POST route "/register"
        Append the following chain of checks (=chain of middleware) to validate email and password
            email must be present and needs to be an actual email
            password needs to be min 4 and max 10 characters
        Add validation in your route
            Perform validation by const errors = validationResult(req)
            Check if there are errors using errors.isEmpty()
                If so: Return these as json to the client
                If not: Return the received form data to the client

    Testing
        Call your /register form in the browser and sent data
        Sent correct data first to test if your POST route still works
        Now send incorrect data, e.g. an email without an @ sign
        Check if you get back an error response
        Now test wrong entries for the password field too!
